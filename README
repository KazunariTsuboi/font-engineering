# Font engineering tools

This repository contains a number of smaller scripts and libraries that I find useful in my font engineering work and don't want to keep to myself.

## shape

This is a simple wrapper for `hb-shape` and `hb-view`, but I use it *all the
time* - like, *hundreds* of times a day. You will need to be using
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html) for your terminal and install the [shell integration](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) tools so that it can display images inline. Once you've done that, use `shape <fontfile> <text>` to display both the shaped glyph string and the output image in your termal. You can also pass any command line arguments that make sense to `hb-shape` or `hb-view`: `-V` to get a shaping trace, `--features=...` and so on:

Top tip: if you're using `zsh` for your shell, add this to your `.zshrc` and you will be able to tab-complete font files:

    compdef '_files -g "*.?tf"' shape

## interrofont

General purpose tool for investigating OTF/TTF information from the command line. See http://www.corvelsoftware.co.uk/software/interrofont/ for usage.

## fontshell

Sometimes you need to poke at a font in its fontTools representation. I got very tired of typing

```
>>> from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
>>> font = TTFont("whatever.otf")
```

*every single time*, so I wrote `fontshell`. Run `fontshell whatever.otf` and you are dropped into a Python REPL with the `font` variable set to a `fontTools.ttLib.ttFont.TTFont` object. Bonus: If you have IPython installed, you get tab completion of methods *and* pretty colours too!

## dumptable

This extracts a table from a sfnt file and outputs it as a raw binary string. I use this when debugging glyph naming issues and other times TTX gets too clever and doesn't tell me everything I need to know about a table. It's rare that you'll need it, but if you need it, you'll *really* need it.

## compare_shape.py

I was converting a font from one format to another, and wanted to make sure that the layout rules were equivalent between the two. This script takes two fonts and a list of words, and checks that the shaping output from Harfbuzz is equal, outputting a report of passed and failed tests, as well as any shaping differences.

## shape-diff.py

So, `compare_shape.py` told you that a test failed and there was a difference between the shaping outputs of two fonts, but it didn't tell you *why* that happened. That's what `shape-diff.py` does. Give it two fonts and a text, and it'll report what went wrong:

```
$ python3 shape-diff.py NNU.ttf NNU2.ttf 'نسس'
   font1⮯ ⮮font2
✔ GSUB( 5/20)  Noon=0|Seen=1|SeenFin=2
✔ GSUB( 4/19)  Noon=0|SeenMed=1|SeenFin=2
✔ GSUB( 3/15)  BehxIni=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed=1|SeenFin=2
✔ GSUB(26/85)  BehxIni.outT2=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.inT2outT2=1|SeenFin=2
✔ GSUB(27/86)  BehxIni.outT2tall=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.inT2outT2=1|SeenFin=2
✔ GSUB(28/87)  BehxIni.outD1=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.SWinAoutT2=1|SeenFin=2

First difference appeared at GSUB lookup 158 (font1) / 37 (font2)
font1          BehxIni.outD1=0|sp0=0|sp0=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.SWinAoutT2=1|SeenFin=2
font2          BehxIni.outD1=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.SWinAoutT2=1|SeenFin=2
```

## vharfbuzz.py

`shape-diff.py` requires a library called vharfbuzz, which is a smarter wrapper around the wonderful [uharfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/uharfbuzz). uharfbuzz is a bridge between Python and harfbuzz, but it's quite low-level. vharfbuzz makes it a tiny bit easier to use. See the docstrings for this module. Here is a sample session:

```python
>>> v = Vharfbuzz("Roboto-Regular.ttf")
>>> buf = v.shape("official")
>>> v.serialize_buf(buf)
'o=0+1168|f=1+711|fi=2+1134|c=4+1072|i=5+497|a=6+1114|l=7+497'
```
