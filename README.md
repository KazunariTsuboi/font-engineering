# Font engineering tools

This repository contains a number of smaller scripts and libraries that I find useful in my font engineering work and don't want to keep to myself.

## [`shape`](./shape)

This is a simple wrapper for `hb-shape` and `hb-view`, but I use it _all the
time_ - like, _hundreds_ of times a day. You will need to be using
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/index.html) for your terminal and install the [shell integration](https://www.iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) tools so that it can display images inline. Once you've done that, use `shape <fontfile> <text>` to display both the shaped glyph string and the output image in your termal. You can also pass any command line arguments that make sense to `hb-shape` or `hb-view`: `-V` to get a shaping trace, `--features=...` and so on:

![](shape.png)

Top tip: if you're using `zsh` for your shell, add this to your `.zshrc` and you will be able to tab-complete font files:

    compdef '_files -g "*.?tf"' shape

## [`interrofont`](./interrofont)

General purpose tool for investigating OTF/TTF information from the command line. See http://www.corvelsoftware.co.uk/software/interrofont/ for usage.

## [`fontshell`](./fontshell)

Sometimes you need to poke at a font in its fontTools representation. I got very tired of typing

```python-console
>>> from fontTools.ttLib import TTFont
>>> font = TTFont("whatever.otf")
```

_every single time_, so I wrote `fontshell`. Run `fontshell whatever.otf` and you are dropped into a Python REPL with the `font` variable set to a `fontTools.ttLib.ttFont.TTFont` object. Bonus: If you have IPython installed, you get tab completion of methods _and_ pretty colours too!

## [`dumptable`](./dumptable)

This extracts a table from a sfnt file and outputs it as a raw binary string. I use this when debugging glyph naming issues and other times TTX gets too clever and doesn't tell me everything I need to know about a table. It's rare that you'll need it, but if you need it, you'll _really_ need it.

## [`compare_shape.py`](./compare_shape.py)

I was converting a font from one format to another, and wanted to make sure that the layout rules were equivalent between the two. This script takes two fonts and a list of words, and checks that the shaping output from Harfbuzz is equal, outputting a report of passed and failed tests, as well as any shaping differences.

## [`shape-diff.py`](./shape-diff.py)

So, `compare_shape.py` told you that a test failed and there was a difference between the shaping outputs of two fonts, but it didn't tell you _why_ that happened. That's what `shape-diff.py` does. Give it two fonts and a text, and it'll report what went wrong:

```console
$ python3 shape-diff.py NNU.ttf NNU2.ttf 'Ù†Ø³Ø³'
   font1â®¯ â®®font2
âœ” GSUB( 5/20)  Noon=0|Seen=1|SeenFin=2
âœ” GSUB( 4/19)  Noon=0|SeenMed=1|SeenFin=2
âœ” GSUB( 3/15)  BehxIni=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed=1|SeenFin=2
âœ” GSUB(26/85)  BehxIni.outT2=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.inT2outT2=1|SeenFin=2
âœ” GSUB(27/86)  BehxIni.outT2tall=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.inT2outT2=1|SeenFin=2
âœ” GSUB(28/87)  BehxIni.outD1=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.SWinAoutT2=1|SeenFin=2

First difference appeared at GSUB lookup 158 (font1) / 37 (font2)
font1          BehxIni.outD1=0|sp0=0|sp0=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.SWinAoutT2=1|SeenFin=2
font2          BehxIni.outD1=0|OneDotAboveNS=0|SeenMed.SWinAoutT2=1|SeenFin=2
```

## [`vharfbuzz.py`](./vharfbuzz.py)

`shape-diff.py` requires a library called vharfbuzz, which is a smarter wrapper around the wonderful [uharfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/uharfbuzz). uharfbuzz is a bridge between Python and harfbuzz, but it's quite low-level. vharfbuzz makes it a tiny bit easier to use. See the docstrings for this module. Here is a sample session:

```python
>>> v = Vharfbuzz("Roboto-Regular.ttf")
>>> buf = v.shape("official")
>>> v.serialize_buf(buf)
'o=0+1168|f=1+711|fi=2+1134|c=4+1072|i=5+497|a=6+1114|l=7+497'
```

## [`stringbrewer`](./stringbrewer)

StringBrewer has graduated to [its own repository](https://github.com/simoncozens/stringbrewer).


## [`gnipahs.py`](./gnipahs.py)

`gnipahs` is a regression tester for font shaping. You pass it a font file
and a series of tests (some of which can be StringBrewer recipes) and it will
check your shaping. The default tests are for overlaps (using [collidoscope](https://github.com/simoncozens/collidoscope)) and shaping expectations. For example, here is a regression test file:

```
# This is a comment
#
# Literals (in quotes) by themselves just run the overlap test
"Ù¾Ù¾Ù¾"
#
# You can also test that the shaping output is what you expect.
#
"Ø³Ø¨Û’":BARI_YEf1=2+272|sdb.yb=1+0|BEm8=1+227@<0,275>|SINi9=0+450@<0,311>
"Ø¨Ù…Ù…Û’":BARI_YEf1=3+272|MIMm6=2+104@<0,275>|MIMm4=1+203@<0,431>|sdb=0+0@<-34,230>|BEi7=0+412@<0,662>
#
# Lines without quotes are StringBrewer recipes
#
DotsBelow{0,3}
DotsBelow{0,3} TrickyEndCharacters

SomethingWithDotsBelow = Ø¨,ÛŒ,Ù¾
TrickyEndCharacters = ÛŒ,Û’
```

This may output test results like so:

```
% python3 font.otf regression.txt
ðŸ—¸  'Ù¾Ù¾Ù¾' overlap test
ðŸ—´  'Ø³Ø¨Û’' overlap test
ðŸ—´  'Ø³Ø¨Û’' shaping text: expected BARI_YEf1=2+272|sdb.yb=1+0|BEm8=1+227@<0,275>|SINi9=0+450@<0,311> got BARI_YEf1=2+272|sdb=1+0@<-26,58>|BEm8=1+227@<0,275>|SINi9=0+450@<0,311>

...

ðŸ—´  'Ù¾Ù¾Ø¨Û’' overlap test
ðŸ—´  'Ù¾Ù¾ÛŒÛ’' overlap test
ðŸ—´  'Ù¾Ù¾Ù¾Û’' overlap test

125 tests, 35 passed, 90 failing
```

Oh dear.
